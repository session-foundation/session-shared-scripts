# Session Shared Scripts

This repo houses scripts which are shared between the different platform repos for Session, it also contains a number of Actions used to automatically sync some shared elements across the repos.

## Crowdin Translation Workflow

Automated workflow that downloads translations from Crowdin, validates them, and creates PRs for iOS and Android platforms and for the Typescript Localization Module for Desktop and QA.

### Required Secrets

| Secret              | Description                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CROWDIN_API_TOKEN` | Crowdin personal access token (see scopes below)         |
| `CROWDIN_PR_TOKEN`  | GitHub token with PR creation permissions                |

#### Crowdin token scopes

Crowdin scopes personal access tokens per endpoint family, so a token missing one
scope returns `403 Forbidden` on just those endpoints while every other call keeps
working. The scripts in this repo need:

| Scope                  | Value                | Needed for                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Projects               | `project`            | Project details and the target-language list                            |
| Source files & strings | `project.source`     | Listing source strings (`approve_strings.py`, multiple-translations report) |
| Translations           | `project.translation` | Translation exports, plus reading/adding approvals and translations     |
| Glossaries             | `glossary`           | Non-translatable strings (glossary terms)                               |

> **Note:** Scopes only cap what a token may do — they don't grant anything the
> token's Crowdin account can't already do, so the account also needs a project
> role that allows it (manager/proofreader for anything that writes, e.g. the
> approvals `POST` in `approve_strings.py`).

### Workflow Inputs

| Input                    | Default | Description                              |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `UPDATE_PULL_REQUESTS`   | `true`  | Create/update PRs for all platforms      |
| `SKIP_VALIDATION_ERRORS` | `false` | Continue even if string validation fails |

### Schedule

Runs automatically every Monday at 00:00 UTC.

### Validation Rules

#### All Strings (including plurals)

- **Valid `{variable}` syntax** - No broken braces (`{`, `}`, `{}`, `{ space }`)
- **Allowed HTML tags only** - Only `<b>`, `<br/>`, `<span>`
- **Valid tag syntax** - No malformed `<` (e.g., `<script>`, `<123>`)

#### Non-Plural Strings Only

- **Variables match English** - Same `{variables}` as source locale
- **Tag count matches English** - Same number of tags (warning only)

#### All Locales

- **No extra keys** - No strings that don't exist in English

> **Note:** Plural strings skip variable/tag comparison because languages have different plural forms (English: 2, Arabic: 6, Russian: 4). It would be nice to add suppot for plural validation in the future.

## Workflow Failure Notificaiton

If a workflow fails and is in the list of workflows monitored by the failure notificaiton workflow, the failure notificaiton workflow will send a message to a discord webhook.

### Required Secrets

| Secret                | Description                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Url for the Discord webhook        |
| `DISCORD_ROLE_ID`     | Discord role id to tag in messages |

### Trigger Test Notification

The failure notification can be triggered by manualy running the Test Failure Notification workflow.
